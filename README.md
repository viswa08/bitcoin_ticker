# bitcoin_ticker

A Flutter mobile-focused application to track Bitcoin ticker values for multiple currency values. The desired currency can be selected with the Dropdown menu.

CoinAPI.io was super helpful in building this project to learn and practice API connection and networking with Flutter.

To try this project out enter your CoinAPI key, Don't try my key in the previous commit, I would have obviously scrapped that by the time.

Further improvements:
- Multiple cryptocurrencies
- Historical data
